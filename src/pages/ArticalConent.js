      `Welcome! Today we're going to be talking about the fastest way to learn React.
    I'm going to be showing you how to create this application right here, which is a simple
    blog app that pulls posts from a JSON placeholder. We're going to be using React Hooks,
    which is a new feature introduced in React 16.8. It allows you to use state and other
    React features without writing a class. We're also going to be using React Router, which
    is the standard routing library for React. It allows you to define routes in your
    application and have your application navigate to different pages based on those routes.
    We're also going to be using Axios, which is a library that allows you to make HTTP
    requests to external resources. In our case, we're going to be using it to pull posts
    from the JSON placeholder API. And finally, we're going to be using React Markdown,
    which is a library that allows you to take Markdown content and convert it into HTML.
    So, let's get started!`,
